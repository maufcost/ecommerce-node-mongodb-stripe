# Complete e-commerce website using NodeJS, MongoDB, and the Stripe API

For the past few months, I switched from Django to Nodejs in order to get a greater familiarity with server-side Javascript and MongoDB to broaden the scope of technologies I know. I've just finished building an e-commerce website using the Stripe API, MongoDB, and Passport! Great experience! I am really looking forward to using Mongo again in my next projects!

Technologies used:
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* Stripe API
* Bootstrap
* JS libraries, such as Passport.
